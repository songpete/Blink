    Welcome to Blink

    What's a blink you ask? They're shorter versions of longer links... you know, the ones that are only about 700 characters long and look like http://www.something.com/wkerj/doc/hi/version42/part123/iatetheicecream/hello-world/version2437.html. Sooo awkward to share with your friends.

    A blink is a little link that works just as well as the longer one, but they're lighter and easier to carry around!
